* Tool to validate XML responses from Authn/Authz SPI 

The appliance does not provide good error messages when using the Authn/Authz SPI. For example, see Google bug #240337. We can provide appliance admins with a tool that sends a request to their Authn/Authz servers and validates the responses using xmllint.

* Example code for doing field-based search using the appliance

You can use meta tags to do field-based search on the appliance. For example, show all database records of people who play soccer and live in London. It would be good for us to provide some sample code that GSA administrators can easily modify.
